# Santiago Sánchez Reyes

Computer Science student at Tecnológico de Monterrey focused on **Data Science, Marketing Analytics, and Behavioral Modeling**.

My work centers on applying quantitative methods and machine learning to understand **human decision-making, consumer behavior, and market dynamics**, translating complex datasets into structured insights that drive measurable business outcomes.

## Research & Professional Interests

I am particularly interested in the intersection of:

* **Data Science & Machine Learning**
  Predictive modeling, regression analysis, classification systems, clustering, and behavioral segmentation. My focus is on extracting robust signal from noisy real-world data.

* **Marketing Analytics & Consumer Behavior**
  Customer lifetime value (CLV), churn prediction, demand forecasting, pricing analytics, and experimentation (A/B testing, causal inference).

* **Behavioral Modeling & Decision Systems**
  Quantifying how cognitive biases, incentives, and environmental variables shape economic and digital behavior.

* **Applied AI for Business Strategy**
  Designing data-driven decision frameworks that integrate operational, financial, and behavioral metrics.

* **Operational & Retail Analytics**
  Optimization models for inventory allocation, performance tracking, and resource prioritization.

My objective is to build analytical systems that meaningfully influence how organizations design products, allocate capital, and engage markets.

## Current Technical Focus

* **Python for Data Science** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
* **Statistical Modeling & Regression Analysis**
* **Machine Learning Model Evaluation & Validation**
* **Experimental Design & Hypothesis Testing**
* **SQL for Data Extraction & Transformation**
* **Data Visualization & Analytical Communication**
* **Causal Reasoning in Business Contexts**

I prioritize methodological rigor, interpretability, and reproducibility in all analytical work.
