# 👋 Hi, I’m @Santiagoschzr

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Computer Science student** at Tecnológico de Monterrey, passionate about using technology to create solutions that drive real change in business, society, and everyday life.

## 👀 About Me

I’m deeply interested in exploring the intersection between **technology, business innovation, and social impact**. Throughout my career, I’ve been involved in different projects, from **software development** to **automation, data visualization, and network design**. What motivates me most is working on solutions that go beyond code — solutions that improve processes, create opportunities, and help people thrive.

Some areas that I’m especially passionate about:
- **Tech for Business**: Helping businesses innovate through technology, from software solutions to process optimization and automation.
- **Product Development**: Designing products that focus on user experience and solving real user needs.
- **Data & Visualization**: Using data analysis and visualization to make better decisions.
- **Social Impact Tech**: Developing technology that addresses social problems and improves lives, like my recent work in environmental and recycling apps.
- **Entrepreneurship & Startups**: I believe in the power of tech to create new businesses that change industries.

## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning

- **React & Frontend Development**: Building user-centered web applications.
- **Business Consulting & Tech Strategy**: How to use technology to drive growth in companies.
- **Software Development Best Practices**: Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
- **Cloud & Networking Fundamentals**: Gaining a stronger understanding of how to build secure and efficient infrastructures.
- **UI/UX Design**: Creating better user experiences and product flows.

## 💻 Projects I’m Working On / Have Worked On

- **ResicloApp**: A recycling app that connects users with nearby recycling centers and helps them track their recycling habits.
- **Network Design**: Building and simulating business networks with Cisco Packet Tracer (VLANs, DNS, Telnet, Routing, etc.).
- **Automation Systems**: Projects using Python for logistics simulations (with tools like Mesa) and Unity for 3D visualizations of warehouse logistics.
- **Consulting for Small Businesses**: Through my student consulting club, helping companies solve operational and tech-related challenges.

## 💞️ I’m Looking to Collaborate On

- **Tech projects that solve real-world problems**, especially those with social, environmental, or business impact.
- **Startups or product teams** needing help in early-stage tech development or product design.
- **Data visualization and automation** tools for businesses.
- **Collaborative open-source projects** that aim to improve communities or business processes.

## ⚡ Fun Fact

Although I’m deeply involved in tech, I also come from a **family business background**, so I’m always thinking about how to bridge the gap between technology and real business needs. I believe that **great tech should serve people, not the other way around**, and I’m on a mission to build tools that make life simpler and better. Also, I love exploring new ways to connect tech with psychology, social impact, and entrepreneurship!
